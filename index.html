	    <p class="about-text">I put this site together as a way of keeping track of birds (which has become an interest of mine), and also to scratch my web design itch. The list is limited to birds my wife and I have spotted directly around our yard in Thornton, Colorado.</p>
		<p class="about-text">On the property there are two bird feeders. One is located in a young poplar in the back yard, and the other in a maple in the front. Below the maple is a bird bath, which the sparrows and blue jays especially seem to enjoy.</p>
		<p class="about-text">In the back is a towering old cottonwood where the hawks and owls like to sit and observe. Thick bushes line the perimeter and provide ample cover. All this, combined with a lack of pets, seems to have made my small patch of earth quite attractive to local birds.</p>
